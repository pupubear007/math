**Abstract** (plain text for the submission form):

> We give a diagrammatic representation of deductive and inductive reasoning in which deduction is
> a certain passage from thought to existence, and induction is a tentative, iterated passage from
> the study of existence to the theory of thought. We make the diagram precise in a
> possible-worlds semantics: thoughts are propositions about worlds, deduction is semantic
> entailment, polarity distinguishes affirmation from modus tollens, and an inductive theory is
> supported by a study when some world is consistent with both. Within this setting we prove that
> deduction is sound and transitive, that iterated observation can only narrow the supported
> theories, that a single counterexample falsifies a universal theory, and that no finite study
> entails a universal theory over an unobserved individual. The last statement is a formal
> version of Hume's problem of induction. As an application we realize the framework in quantum
> information theory: thoughts become subspaces, deduction becomes certain measurement and unitary
> evolution, induction becomes state tomography, and the classical setting is recovered as the
> case of commuting observables. The quantum model reproduces refinement, falsification and
> underdetermination, and adds a limitation with no classical counterpart: measurements in a
> single basis never determine a quantum state. We further give a Bayesian refinement of support,
> under which every genuine test a theory predicts confirms it, a ranked semantics for defeasible
> inference, and an order on levels under which iteration moves upward. Every theorem of the paper
> is verified in the Lean 4 proof assistant with Mathlib.

## Before submitting

- [ ] **Make the code reachable.** The paper's Code availability statement points to
      `github.com/pupubear007/math`. Make the repository public (or the formalization directory
      available in a public repository), and merge this branch or link to it. For a journal, also
      archive a release on Zenodo and add its DOI to the statement.
- [ ] **Check the AI-use statement** in "Statements and declarations" and adjust its wording to
      your venue's policy.
- [ ] **Spot-check the references** (author spellings, editions, DOIs), especially the editions
      chosen for Aristotle, Descartes, Hume and Kant.
- [ ] **arXiv endorsement.** First-time submitters to math.LO may need an endorsement from an
      established author in that category.
- [ ] **Journal version.** The source uses the standard `article` class with numeric references.
      For a journal, move the sections into its template; the `\lean{...}` margin names and the
      appendix table carry over unchanged.
